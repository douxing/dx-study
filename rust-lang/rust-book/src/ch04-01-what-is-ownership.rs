/*
all problems that ownership addresses. 
1. keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap
2. minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap
3. cleaning up unused data on the heap so we don’t run out of space

/*
Ownership Rules

1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
